    #  Xtrain  : a numpy.ndarray matrix of size [m x n] and type 'float' where each row
    #            is a n-dimensional input example (assume it already contains the constant feature set to 1)
    #  Ytrain  : a numpy.ndarray vector of size [m x 1] and type 'float', where the
    #            i-th element is the correct labelfor the i-th input example.
    #  opt     : it is a `str', it can be either 'random' or 'heuristic' which allows to
    #            choose the initialization between randomly of heuristic

    # OUTPUT
    #  theta   : a numpy.ndarray vector of size [n x 1] and type 'float'
    #            containing the initialized parameter vector
    #
    # HINTS
    #  We provide the code for random initialization and ask you to implement
    #  the case of 'heuristicâ€™, which we have discussed in class.
